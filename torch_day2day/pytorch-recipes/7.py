test_sentence = """The popularity of the term "data science" has exploded in 
business environments and academia, as indicated by a jump in job openings.[32] 
However, many critical academics and journalists see no distinction between data 
science and statistics. Writing in Forbes, Gil Press argues that data science is a 
buzzword without a clear definition and has simply replaced “business analytics” in 
contexts such as graduate degree programs.[7] In the question-and-answer section of 
his keynote address at the Joint Statistical Meetings of American Statistical 
Association, noted applied statistician Nate Silver said, “I think data-scientist 
is a sexed up term for a statistician....Statistics is a branch of science. 
Data scientist is slightly redundant in some way and people shouldn’t berate the 
term statistician.”[9] Similarly, in business sector, multiple researchers and 
analysts state that data scientists alone are far from being sufficient in granting 
companies a real competitive advantage[33] and consider data scientists as only 
one of the four greater job families companies require to leverage big 
data effectively, namely: data analysts, data scientists, big data developers 
and big data engineers.[34]

On the other hand, responses to criticism are as numerous. In a 2014 Wall Street 
Journal article, Irving Wladawsky-Berger compares the data science enthusiasm with 
the dawn of computer science. He argues data science, like any other interdisciplinary 
field, employs methodologies and practices from across the academia and industry, but 
then it will morph them into a new discipline. He brings to attention the sharp criticisms 
computer science, now a well respected academic discipline, had to once face.[35] Likewise, 
NYU Stern's Vasant Dhar, as do many other academic proponents of data science,[35] argues 
more specifically in December 2013 that data science is different from the existing practice 
of data analysis across all disciplines, which focuses only on explaining data sets. 
Data science seeks actionable and consistent pattern for predictive uses.[1] This practical 
engineering goal takes data science beyond traditional analytics. Now the data in those 
disciplines and applied fields that lacked solid theories, like health science and social 
science, could be sought and utilized to generate powerful predictive models.[1]""".split()
